    <p id="p1">Let's suppose we have created our web page using a simple HTML code, and 
        we want something which can present our page in a correct format, 
        and visibly attractive. So to do this, we can style our web page with CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) properties.</p>

        <p id="p2">CSS is used to apply the style in the web page which is made up of HTML elements. It describes the look of the webpage.</p>

CSS provides various style properties such as background color, padding, margin, border-color, and many more, to style a webpage.

<p id="p3">Each property in CSS has a name-value pair, and each property is separated by a semicolon (;).</p>
